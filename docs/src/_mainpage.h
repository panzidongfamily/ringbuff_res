 *
 *  - Written in ANSI C99, compatible with `size_t` for size data types
 *  - Platform independent, no architecture specific code
 *  - FIFO (First In First Out) buffer implementation
 *  - No dynamic memory allocation, data is static array
 *  - Uses optimized memory copy instead of loops to read/write data from/to memory
 *  - Thread safe when used as pipe with single write and single read entries
 *  - Interrupt safe when used as pipe with single write and single read entries
 *  - Suitable for DMA transfers from and to memory with zero-copy between buffer and application memory
 *  - Supports data peek, skip for read and advance for write
 *  - User friendly MIT license
